## About

Project submitted for a front+back end course, realised by [Eva Chibane ](https://github.com/evzs) and [Marianne Corbel](https://github.com/RathGate). Discover the Miaou Shop: merch items based on our beloved cats (and Ethan's cat too because he's funny).

You can find how we divided our work in the `/docs` folder of this repository!

## Technical Specifications

 - Back-end & API : Express JS
 - API data format : JSON
 - Front-end: HTML, CSS, JS

**COMPATIBILITY:** For now, the website is not responsive and is not intended to be before the handing out of the project, since we didn't have a lot of time. An update might come later to fix that !

## API details

We have created an entire API with express JS to send the data to the website.

The API does have rate limitation and 404 handling, but we haven't implemented any user verification (token for example) yet and there's no written documentation. But it **will** come in the future!


## How to use the program

For now, the website has not been hosted anywhere, though we might find a way to host it in the future. In order to visit it on your computer, you must run the express server (needed to make the API work).

To clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/evzs/CHIBANE-CORBEL-shopping-app.git

Then, launch a terminal in the `/src/backend` folder:

    npm install
    npm start

You just have to either launch a liveserver and open the index.html, or open it directly in your computer files. Enjoy !
